                    <p>Do you want to learn how to code a website? Behind the scenes, most website code contains HTML,
                        CSS, and JavaScript.

                        As a beginner, learning these programming languages (even at a beginner level) requires hours of
                        studying and practice.

                        The good news for business owners is that there are excellent tools that let you create any type
                        of website (without writing code).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this comprehensive guide, we’ll cover how to code a website by using drag and drop tools that
                        create all the code for you.

                        For those who want to code a website from scratch, we will share how to learn the code
                        fundamentals, so you can do just that.
                        Website Builders vs. Code a Website From Scratch
                        In the early days of internet, building a website used to be hard. That’s because developers had
                        to code a website from scratch which would take hours if not weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Business owners had no other option but to pay thousands of dollars to have someone build / code
                        a website.

                        Even as website builders got introduced, many businesses preferred to hire professional
                        developers to build their websites because those tools simply couldn’t offer the same quality.

                        However in 2020, that has changed.

                        Many developers are now using WordPress and other CMS platforms (website builder frameworks) to
                        speed up the process of building websites.

                        Over 62.9% of all websites on the internet are built on a website framework, so in other words
                        majority of developers don’t write website code from scratch anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The truth is that in 95% of cases, you can build just as good of a website with website builders
                        or no-code solutions as you would writing website code from scratch.

                        Since time is our most valuable asset, we’ll show you the fastest ways to code a website by
                        using tools that do the code writing for you (method 1 and method 2 will cover this).

                        In method 3, we will share resources on how to code a website from scratch. This is great for
                        students who want to learn programming.

                        With that said, let’s take a look at how to code a website.

                    <p>
                        1. Code a Custom Website with WordPress
                        WordPress is the most popular website builder platform because it powers over 35% of all
                        websites on the internet.

                        It comes with multiple tools that let you create a custom website from scratch without learning
                        how to code.

                        Our #1 pick is the Beaver Builder framework.
